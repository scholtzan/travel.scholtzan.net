After about four months my exchange semester came to an end and I had to leave South Korea. My exchange semester in South Korea was a time of many new experiences and brought me a lot of new friend from all over the world. It certainly helped me to improve my Korean and gave me a deeper insight into the Korean way of life. Also the contact to other exchange and international students introduced me to many other interesting cultures and perspectives. I am very grateful for all the unique experiences I had during this time.

Although it is sad that this adventure is now over, another exciting adventure is already awaiting me: I will start my master's degree in Canada in Fall. Eventually I might post some of my adventures in Canada here too.
