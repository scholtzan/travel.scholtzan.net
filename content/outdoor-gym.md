One of the great things in South Korea is that in almost every park there is an outdoor gym. Though most of the equipment seems to be intended for old people there are also some more serious weight lifting machines. And everything is for free.

Close to the campus is a small lake with two outdoor gyms. I go there often to exercise and relax.

The lake is also great for running. Especially during Spring when all the trees are blooming its really nice to go there.
