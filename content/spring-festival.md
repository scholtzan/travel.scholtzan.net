Spring arrived in South Korea! This means not only warmer temperatures but also blooming of cherry blossoms. Traditionally, there are several spring festivals that celebrate the start of the season. One of those festivals is the Yeongdeungpo Yeouido Spring Flower Festival. The festival takes place on the road behind the National Assembly Building. Along the road were about 1,800 cherry trees in full bloom. And also a lot of visitors.

At the same day, we also headed to the Spring festival around Seokchonhosu Lake. This lake is near the Lotte World Tower in the center of Seoul and was even more beautiful that the previous Spring festival. There was also a stage were musicians and K-Pop artists performed.

On the lake is also a small island with an amusement park called "Lotte World". The park reminded me of a small copy of Disney Land, because there was also a fairy tale castle. One could also hear the cries of the visitors riding the roller coasters in the distance.

After a day of a lot of walking and many cherry blossoms trees we had tasty Bulgogi for dinner. And free ice cream.
