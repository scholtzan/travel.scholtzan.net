안녕하세요!

In this blog I will write about my experiences as an exchange student at Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea.
Sungkyunkwan University consists of two (very large) campuses. As I am a computer science master's student all of my courses will take place on the Natural Science Campus in Suwon.
I will also provide some information about preparation and other things to consider in hope to give future exchange students some useful hints.

I'm really looking forward to the following months!
