Although I have already been in Canada for about 10 months since starting my master's degree here, I did not manage to write a single post about it. But I believe, it is never too late to start! That is why I am planning to write about past, current and future adventures during my time in Canada. I realized during my time in Korea that these posts are not only a great way to keep family and friends up-to-date but they also serve as reminders f of many firsts and exciting experiences for myself.
